=head1 NAME

openhpi - an implementation of the SA Forum's Hardware Platform Interface

=head1 DESCRIPTION

OpenHPI is an implementation of the SA Forum's Hardware Platform
Interface, which provides a standard C library interface to manage,
monitor, and control hardware (both local and remote).

OpenHPI 1.x implements the HPI A.01.01 specification.  Both that spec
and OpenHPI 1.x are deprecated, and users should use HPI B.01.01 and
OpenHPI 2.x.

OpenHPI 2.x implements the HPI B.01.01 specification.

=head1 ENVIRONMENTAL VARIABLES

Some of OpenHPI's functioning can be changed by setting environment
variables.  This documents all known environmental settings and how
they affect OpenHPI.

=over 4

=item B<OPENHPI_THREADED>=YES

Turns on threading engine in OpenHPI, which spawns a thread to handle
event harvesting and processing.  This is off by default, as it isn't
strictly needed for many uses of HPI.  However the BLOCK and TIMED
wait on the I<saHpiEventGet> function can only be supported if this is
set.

=item B<OPENHPI_UID_MAP>=FILENAME

The map file to use for persistant entitypath to resource id
database.  By default /var/lib/openhpi/uid_map is used.  This allows
you to override that at run time.

=item B<OPENHPI_DEBUG>=YES

Turns on debugging messages.  This will print additional text when any
error conditions arise.  If a problem is happening with OpenHPI, it
is good to turn on debugging to see if that shows more information.

=item B<OPENHPI_CONF>=FILENAME

Location of openhpi.conf file.  Default location is
/etc/openhpi/openhpi.conf.

=head1 HARDWARE SUPPORT

OpenHPI provides a number of plugins that talk to different hardware
types.  The following is a list of tested plugins in OpenHPI 2.x.

=over 4

=item B<ipmi>

An IPMI plugin that can talk locally (via smi interface and OpenIPMI
device driver) or remotely (via IPMI over LAN).  It supports IPMI 1.5
for standard rackmount servers, and some of IPMI 2.0 for support of
ATCA chassis.

IPMI plugin depends on libOpenIPMI version 1.4.x.

=item B<ipmidirect>

An IPMI plugin designed specifically for ATCA chassis.  It implements
IPMI commands directly in the plugin.

=item B<snmp_bc>

An SNMP based plugin that can communicate with IBM BladeCenter, as
well as IBM xSeries servers with RSA 1 adapters.

SNMP_BC plugin depends on net-snmp > 5.0.7.

=item B<sysfs>
