  <title>Introduction</title>
  <para>

OpenHPI is an open source project created with the intent of providing
an implementation of the Service Availability Forum's Hardware Platform 
Interface (HPI).  HPI provides a universal interface for creating resource 
system models, typically for chassis and rack based servers, but extendable 
for other problem domains such as clustering, virtualization and simulation.

    <title>Purpose of this Document</title>
    <para>

This document is intended to combine collaborated design effort into a single
location.  This HLD should specify the implementation, including 
inter-component dependencies, providing sufficient design detail to correctly 
implement the SA Forum's HPI for multiple platforms.

    <title>Document Scope</title>
    <para>

This high-level design covers all levels of design and may evolve into a 
low-level design as the document matures. Anyone interested in understanding 
the OpenHPI internal design should read this document.
