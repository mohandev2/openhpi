  <title>OpenHPI Plugin Development Guide</title>
  <para>
	This chapter is a developer's guide to writing an openhpi plug-in.
	The hope is that by providing this documentation in addition to
	the source code in CVS, developers will have all the tools needed
	to enable support for a given platform under openhpi.

    <title>General plug-in concepts</title>
    <para>
	As explained earlier in this manual, plug-ins are at the heart of openhpi.
	They serve as the proxy to hardware management interfaces and protocols.
	A plug-in has two main roles.
	First, to interface with the hardware management interface and gather data.
	Second, format that data into HPI data structures and send them up to the
	main openHpi library.
	
	Further, as openHpi based application need to communicate commands to the
	hardware, the infrastructure library uses the 'abi' interface functions
	to communicate with a plug-in and send commands and/or data to the hardware.
