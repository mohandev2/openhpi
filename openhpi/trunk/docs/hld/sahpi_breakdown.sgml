  <title>SA HPI Breakdown</title>
  <para>The following chapter is designed as a primer on the SA HPI
    specification.  It is meant to represent the OpenHPI teams
    interpretation and explaination of various portions of the spec as we
    see it, and to help new users and developers come up to speed quickly
    in understanding the specification.  This chapter should always be
    considered a work in progress, and any questions or comments on it
    should be sent to the openhpi-devel@lists.sf.net mailing list.

    <title>10,000 foot view - Resources</title>
    <para>
      HPI provides a platform management interface which is entirely
      based on resources.  The crux of the entire HPI model is the
      Resource Presence Table (RPT).  Everything which can exist
      physically is represented in the RPT.  Every domain (we'll
      address domains later) contains one, and only one RPT.
    </para>
    <para>
      The RPT is a concept in HPI, though it isn't actually a data
      structure.  It is expected that implementers will create the
      proper data structure to encapsulate it.  What is specified is 2
      types of information:
