  <title>SA HPI Breakdown</title>
  <para>The following chapter is designed as a primer on the SA HPI
    specification.  It is meant to represent the OpenHPI teams
    interpretation and explaination of various portions of the spec as we
    see it, and to help new users and developers come up to speed quickly
    in understanding the specification.  This chapter should always be
    considered a work in progress, and any questions or comments on it
    should be sent to the openhpi-devel@lists.sf.net mailing list.
