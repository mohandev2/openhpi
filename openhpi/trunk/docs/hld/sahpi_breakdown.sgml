  <title>SA HPI Breakdown</title>
  <para>The following chapter is designed as a primer on the SA HPI
    specification.  It is meant to represent the OpenHPI teams
    interpretation and explaination of various portions of the spec as we
    see it, and to help new users and developers come up to speed quickly
    in understanding the specification.  This chapter should always be
    considered a work in progress, and any questions or comments on it
    should be sent to the openhpi-devel@lists.sf.net mailing list.

      <title>Resources</title>
      <para>
        HPI provides a platform management interface which is entirely
        based on resources.  The crux of the entire HPI model is the
        Resource Presence Table (RPT).  Everything which can exist
        physically is represented in the RPT.  Every domain (we'll
        address domains later) contains one, and only one RPT.
      </para>
      <para>
        The RPT is a concept in HPI, though it isn't actually a data
        structure.  It is expected that implementers will create the
        proper data structure to encapsulate it.  What is specified is 2
        types of information:
      </para>
      <itemizedlist mark='opencircle'>
        <listitem>
          <para><emphasis>SaHpiRptInfoT</emphasis> - a meta data structure that
            contains the update time and incremental counter for the RPT.
          </para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para><emphasis>SaHpiRptEntryT</emphasis> - The actually Resource
            Presence Table entries. It is expected that there will be
            many of them.
          </para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>
    </sect2>
    <sect2>
      <title>Resource Capabilities</title>
      <para>
        Every RPT entry has one field dedicated to capabilities of the
        resource.  This field is a 32bit vector, each bit
        corresponding to a capability.  They include:

      <para>
        The following is an unrolling of SA HPI Data Structures
        surrounding the RPT.  For sake of sanity, it is unrolled only
        as far as the high level RDR types.  Those are broken down later.
