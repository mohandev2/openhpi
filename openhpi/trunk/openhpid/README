This directory contains the openhpi daemon and client library.
openhpiclient.c     - open HPI client code
openhpiclient.conf  - sample configuration for the client library
openhpid.cpp        - the daemon
simple_config.c     - general config file reading code

To run type:
openhpid -d 31
This enables debug messages of the daemon.
To run more than one daemon on the same machine, use
the option -c config_file for different configurations.

To use the daemon, link you HPI application to -lopenhpiclient -lpthread
not -lopenhpi. To run hpitest with the daemon/client library just
change hpitest/v1/1.0/LDFLAGS.
Be aware, hpitest will run in unexpected high speed.

It is possible to build a static version of the daemon:
        ./configure --enable-daemon=static

This version links all the shared libraries of openhpi static to the 
daemon. This does not work with dynamic loaded plugins. Do
        ./configure --enable-daemon=static --enable-dummy=static

instead, when you want to use the static plugin.
Remember to change the openhpi.conf, when you want to use
the static version of the daemon. Replace libdummy with dummy:

plugin  dummy
handler dummy {
        entity_root = "{SYSTEM_CHASSIS,1}"
        name = "test"
        addr =  0
}

instead of

plugin  libdummy
handler libdummy {
        entity_root = "{SYSTEM_CHASSIS,1}"
        name = "test"
        addr =  0
}
