hpiutil

BUILD & INSTALL INSTRUCTIONS

This package uses the OpenHPI library implementation (open-source), 
but there is also an Intel HPI library implementation that could also be 
linked with these utilities, which is close-source (proprietary).  
There are comments in the Makefile to show how this can be done.

How to make the utilities:
1) do ". env.openhpi" to set the environment variables
3) make clean
4) make

How to make the rpm:
mkrpm   (assumes arch = i386)

How to install the rpms:
rpm -i  hpiutil-1.0.4-2.i386.rpm 
   The hpi utilities will be in /usr/bin.
   Other hpi utilities files will be in /usr/share/hpiutil.
