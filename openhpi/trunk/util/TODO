HPIUTIL TODO

- If the SEL is totally empty (not even a 'cleared' message), the SpiLibd
  will not start because the GetSelEntry returns 0xcb.  
  The lib probably needs to set eventid to zero and proceed in this case.

- Further testing with OpenHPI using its ipmi plugin as that project 
  progresses.
