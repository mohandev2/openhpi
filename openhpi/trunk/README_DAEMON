New OpenHPI Daemon Model:
======================
The Default build and installation configuration for OpenHPI has been 
move to the Daemon model.  This results in several operational and 
usage changes.

When the library is built the Daemon is configured to link dynamically 
to 'libopenhpistandard'.   When a user application uses OpenHPI it links 
to 'libopenhpiclient'.  In both cases the user is usually unaware of 
these two libraries.  At any given time a symbolic link is present in 
present in '/usr/local/lib' and pointing to either of the two.

Ex: '/usr/local/lib/libopenhpi.a -> openhpi/client/libopenhpi.a'

Here the link is set for an application to use OpenHPI.

The link is set by use of the scritp 'openhpi-switcher'.  Again the 
user under normal usage  is unaware of this script and its operation.

Three Methods for using the Daemon:
==========================
There are three methods for starting the daemon at this point; manually 
calling the installed 'init script',  manually starting the daemon in 
the foreground,  or installing the 'init script' in one of the system 
run levels and letting the system manage the daemon's execution.  

Manually Calling Init Script:
-----------------------------------
You can START and STOP the Daemon with the 'openhpid' init script.  This 
script first calls 'openhpi-switcher -set=standard' setting libopenhpi 
to be the 'standard' library.  Starts the daemon and upon successful 
execution calls 'openhpi-switcher -set=client' setting libopenhpi to be 
the 'client' library.  An HPI consumer application is now ready to  link 
to 'libopenhpi' and begin interacting with the daemon.  

This script can be found in '/usr/local/etc/init.d/openhpid' or 
alternately if installed in one of the system run levels in 
'/etc/init.d/openhpid'. 

Example To Start:
$sudo /usr/local/etc/init.d/openhpid start
Set default openhpi to standard
Starting openhpid:
Set default openhpi to client                                   [  OK  ]
$

Example To Stop:
$sudo /usr/local/etc/init.d/openhpid stop
Stopping openhpid:                                  [  OK  ]
$

Manually Starting Daemon:
----------------------------------
After performing 'make install' the 'openhpid' init script will reside 
in '<DESTDIR>/etc/init.d/openhpid' and the binary daemon 'openhpid' 
will reside in '<DESTDIR>/sbin/openhpid'. 

If the 'openhpid' init scritp is not used it will be necessary to manually 

1.'openhpi-switcher -set=standard' prior to executing 'openhpid' binary,
2.start daemon 'openhpid [options] [-c <path to openhpi.conf>]'  and 
3.'openhpi-switcher -set=client.  

This method will allow you to run the daemon in the foreground.  See 
'http://wiki.openhpi.org/OpenHPI/Manual/OpenHPIDaemon'.

Example:
From Daemon Shell
>sudo openhpi-switcher --set=standard
Set default openhpi to standard
>sudo  openhpid -n -c/etc/openhpi/openhpi.conf
openhpid started.
OPENHPI_CONF = /etc/openhpi/openhpi.conf
OPENHPI_DAEMON_PORT = 4743

From another shell
>sudo openhpi-switcher -set=client
> [Run your client Application Now]



Installing Daemon into a Run Level:
--------------------------------------------
By using the installation script 'install_initd' the run script 'openhpid' 
can be installed in one the system run levels.  This configuration most 
closely matches a production machine.
