** Resource Info Type Definitions
**
**
** SaHpiResourceInfoT contains static configuration data concerning the
** management controller associated with the resource, or the resource itself.
** Note this information is used to describe the resource; that is, the piece of
** infrastructure which manages an entity (or multiple entities) - NOT the entities
** for which the resource provides management. The purpose of the
** SaHpiResourceInfoT structure is to provide information that the HPI user may
** need in order to interact correctly with the resource (e.g., recognize a
** specific management controller which may have defined OEM fields in sensors,
** OEM controls, etc.).
**
** All of the fields in the following structure may or may not be used by a
** given resource.

/*
** Resource Capabilities
**
** This definition defines the capabilities of a given resource. One resource
** may support any number of capabilities using the bit mask. Every resource
** must set at least one of these capabilities; ie. zero is not a valid value
** for a resource's capabilities.
**
** SAHPI_CAPABILITY_DOMAIN
** SAHPI_CAPABILITY_RESOURCE
** SAHPI_CAPABILITY_EVT_DEASSERTS
** Indicates that all sensors on the resource have the property that their
** Assertion and Deassertion event enable flags are the same. That is,
** for all event states whose assertion triggers an event, it is
** guaranteed that the deassertion of that event will also
** trigger an event. Thus, the user may track the state of sensors on the
** resource by monitoring events rather than polling for state changes.
** SAHPI_CAPABILITY_AGGREGATE_STATUS
** SAHPI_CAPABILITY_CONFIGURATION
** SAHPI_CAPABILITY_MANAGED_HOTSWAP
** Indicates that the resource supports managed hotswap. Since hotswap only
** makes sense for field-replaceable units, the SAHPI_CAPABILITY_FRU
** capability bit must also be set for this resource.
** SAHPI_CAPABILITY_WATCHDOG
** SAHPI_CAPABILITY_CONTROL
** SAHPI_CAPABILITY_FRU
** Indicates that the resource is a field-replaceable unit; i.e., it is
** capable of being removed and replaced in a live system. This does not
** necessarily imply that the resource supports managed hotswap.
** SAHPI_CAPABILITY_INVENTORY_DATA
** SAHPI_CAPABILITY_SEL
** SAHPI_CAPABILITY_RDR
** Indicates that a resource data record (RDR) repository is supplied
** by the resource. Since the existence of an RDR is mandatory, this
** capability must be asserted.
** SAHPI_CAPABILITY_SENSOR
