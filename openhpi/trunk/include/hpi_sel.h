** Event Log Information
**
** The Entries entry denotes the number of active entries contained in the log.
** The Size entry denotes the total number of entries the log is able to hold.
** The UpdateTimestamp entry denotes the timestamp of the last addition,
** deletion or log clear operation.
** The CurrentTime entry denotes the log's idea of the current time; i.e the
** timestamp that would be placed on an entry if it was added now.
** The Enabled entry indicates whether the log is enabled. If the event log
** is "disabled" no events generated within the HPI implementation will be
** added to the event log. Events may still be added to the event log with
** the saHpiEventLogEntryAdd() function. When the event log is "enabled"
** events may be automatically added to the event log as they are generated
** in a resource or a domain, however, it is implementation-specific which
** events are automatically added to any event log.
** The OverflowFlag entry indicates the log has overflowed. Events have been
** dropped or overwritten due to a table overflow.
** The OverflowAction entry indicates the behavior of the SEL when an overflow
** occurs.
** The DeleteEntrySupported indicates whether the delete command is supported for
** event log entries. Note that clearing an entire log is valid even if this
** flag is not set.
