/*
** Time Related Type Definitions
**
** An HPI time value represents the local time as the number of nanoseconds
** from 00:00:00, January 1, 1970, in a 64-bit signed integer. This format
** is sufficient to represent times with nano-second resolution from the
** year 1678 to 2262. Every API which deals with time values must define
** the timezone used.
**
** It should be noted that although nano-second resolution is supported
** in the data type, the actual resolution provided by an implementation
** may be more limited than this.
**
** The value -2**63, which is 0x8000000000000000, is used to indicate
** ?unknown/unspecified time?.
**
** Conversion to/from POSIX and other common time representations is
** relatively straightforward. The following code framgment converts
** between SaHpiTimeT and time_t:
**
** time_t tt1, tt2;
** SaHpiTimeT saHpiTime;
**
** time(&tt1);
** saHpiTime = (SaHpiTimeT) tt1 * 1000000000;
** tt2 = saHpiTime / 1000000000;
**
** The following fragment converts between SaHpiTimeT and a struct timeval:
**
** struct timeval tv1, tv2;
** SaHpiTimeT saHpiTime;
**
** gettimeofday(&tv1, NULL);
** saHpiTime = (SaHpiTimeT) tv1.tv_sec * 1000000000 + tv1.tv_usec * 1000;
** tv2.tv_sec = saHpiTime / 1000000000;
** tv2.tv_usec = saHpiTime % 1000000000 / 1000;
**
** The following fragment converts between SaHpiTimeT and a struct timespec:
**
** struct timespec ts1, ts2;
** SaHpiTimeT saHpiTime;
**
** clock_gettime(CLOCK_REALTIME, &ts1);
** saHpiTime = (SaHpiTimeT) ts1.tv_sec * 1000000000 + ts1.tv_nsec;
** ts2.tv_sec = saHpiTime / 1000000000;
** ts2.tv_nsec = saHpiTime % 1000000000;
**
** Note, however, that since time_t is (effectively) universally 32 bits,
** all of these conversions will cease to work on January 18, 2038.
**
** Some subsystems may need the flexibility to report either absolute or
** relative (eg. to system boot) times. This will typically be in the
** case of a board which may or may not, depending on the system setup,
** have an idea of absolute time. For example, some boards may have
** ?time of day? clocks which start at zero, and never get set to the
** time of day.
**
** In these cases, times which represent ?current? time (in events, for
** example) can be reported based on the clock value, whether it has been
** set to the actual date/time, or whether it represents the elapsed time
** since boot. If it is the time since boot, the value will be (for 27
** years) less than 0x0C00000000000000, which is Mon May 26 16:58:48 1997.
** If the value is greater than this, then it can be assumed to be an
** absolute time.
**
** Every API which can report either absolute or relative times must
** state this rule clearly in its interface specification.
