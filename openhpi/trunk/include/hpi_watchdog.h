/*
** Watchdog Structure
**
** This structure is used by the saHpiWatchdogTimerGet() and
** saHpiWatchdogTimerSet() functions. The use of the structure varies slightly by
** each function.
**
** For saHpiWatchdogTimerGet() :
**
** Log - indicates whether or not the Watchdog is configured to
** issue an event when it next times out. TRUE=event will
** be issued on timeout.
** Running - indicates whether or not the Watchdog is currently
** running or stopped. TRUE=Watchdog is running.
** TimerUse - indicates the current use of the timer; one of five
** preset uses which was included on the last
** saHpiWatchdogTimerSet() function call, or through some
** other implementation-dependent means to start the
** Watchdog timer.
** TimerAction - indicates what action will be taken when the Watchdog
** times out.
** PretimerInterrupt - indicates which action will be taken
** "PreTimeoutInterval" seconds prior to Watchdog timer
** expiration.
** PreTimeoutInterval - indicates how many milliseconds prior to timer time
** out the PretimerInterrupt action will be taken. If
** "PreTimeoutInterval" = 0, the PretimerInterrupt action
** will occur concurrently with "TimerAction." HPI
** implementations may not be able to support millisecond
** resolution and may have a maximum value restriction.
** These restrictions should be documented by the
** provider of the HPI interface.
** TimerUseExpFlags - set of five bit flags which indicate that a Watchdog
** timer timeout has occurred while the corresponding
** TimerUse value was set. Once set, these flags stay
** set until specifically cleared with a
** saHpiWatchdogTimerSet() call, or by some other
** implementation-dependent means.
** InitialCount - The time, in milliseconds, before the timer will time
** out after a saHpiWatchdogTimerReset() function call is
** made, or some other implementation-dependent strobe is
** sent to the Watchdog. HPI implementations may not be
** able to support millisecond resolution and may have a
** maximum value restriction. These restrictions should
** be documented by the provider of the HPI interface.
** PresentCount - The remaining time in milliseconds before the timer
** will time out unless a saHpiWatchdogTimerReset()
** function call is made, or some other implementation-
** dependent strobe is sent to the Watchdog.
** HPI implementations may not be able to support
** millisecond resolution on watchdog timers, but will
** return the number of clock ticks remaining times the
** number of milliseconds between each tick.
**
** For saHpiWatchdogTimerSet():
**
** Log - indicates whether or not the Watchdog should issue
** an event when it next times out. TRUE=event will be
** issued on timeout.
** Running - indicates whether or not the Watchdog should be
** stopped before updating.
** TRUE = Watchdog is not stopped. If it is already
** stopped, it will remain stopped, but if it is
** running, it will continue to run, with the
** countdown timer reset to the new InitialCount.
** Note that there is a race condition possible
** with this setting, so it should be used with
** care.
** FALSE = Watchdog is stopped. After
** saHpiWatchdogTimerSet() is called, a subsequent
** call to saHpiWatchdogTimerReset() is required to
** start the timer.
** TimerUse - indicates the current use of the timer. Will control
** which TimerUseExpFlag is set if the timer expires.
** TimerAction - indicates what action will be taken when the Watchdog
** times out.
** PretimerInterrupt - indicates which action will be taken
** "PreTimeoutInterval" seconds prior to Watchdog timer
** expiration.
** PreTimeoutInterval - indicates how many milliseconds prior to timer time
** out the PretimerInterrupt action will be taken. If
** "PreTimeoutInterval" = 0, the PretimerInterrupt action
** will occur concurrently with "TimerAction." HPI
** implementations may not be able to support millisecond
** resolution and may have a maximum value restriction.
** These restrictions should be documented by the
** provider of the HPI interface.
** TimerUseExpFlags - Set of five bit flags corresponding to the five
** TimerUse values. For each bit set, the corresponding
** Timer Use Expiration Flag will be CLEARED. Generally,
** a program should only clear the Timer Use Expiration
** Flag corresponding to its own TimerUse, so that other
** software, which may have used the timer for another
** purpose in the past can still read its TimerUseExpFlag
** to determine whether or not the timer expired during
** that use.
** InitialCount - The time, in milliseconds, before the timer will time
** out after a saHpiWatchdogTimerReset() function call is
** made, or some other implementation-dependent strobe is
** sent to the Watchdog. HPI implementations may not be
** able to support millisecond resolution and may have a
** maximum value restriction. These restrictions should
** be documented by the provider of the HPI interface.
** PresentCount - Not used on saHpiWatchdogTimerSet() function. Ignored.
