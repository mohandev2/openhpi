This is an implementation of the Service Availability Forum's 
Hardware Platform Interface specification.
The header file was obtained from www.saforum.org/specification/download.

---------------------------------------------------------
PREREQUISITES
---------------------------------------------------------
The following software is required to build openhpi

autoconf >= 2.57
automake >= 1.5
gcc      >= 3.2.0
uuid.h      (may be found in e2fsprogs-devel or uuid-dev)
GLIB-1.2	(note we may be switching to 2.0 in the next release)

The follow libraries are needed to build certain plugins

ipmi plugin
  OpenIPMI >= 0.26 (http://openipmi.sf.net)  suggest tip of CVS.

sysfs plugin
  libsysfs = 0.3

snmp_bc plugin
  net-snmp >= 5.07

snmp_client plugin
  net-snmp >= 5.07

---------------------------------------------------------
BUILD / INSTALLATION
---------------------------------------------------------
First time to extract the code:
run ./BigBuild

This will generate all files needed to compile.

Note: by default all plugins that can be built, will be built.

If you wish to disable a plugin, any flags you pass to BigBuild 
will be passed to the configure program.

i.e. ./BigBuild --disable-dummy will disable the dummy plugin

then make (or make rpm)
and then (as root or with proper system install permissions)
	make install (or install from the rpm).

It will install the openhpi library, enabled plug-ins and sample 
applications that uses the library and plug-ins.

NOTE: the configuration file is only installed by the RPM installation.
	If you run "make install" manually, you will need to:
		cp examples/openhpi.conf.example /etc/openhpi/openhpi.conf
	and modify it for your needs.

---------------------------------------------------------
CLEANUP
---------------------------------------------------------
To remove the temporary build files, type:

make clean

If you are a maintainer, and need to remove all autogenerated files, type:

make clean
make maintainer-clean


---------------------------------------------------------
Active Plug-ins
---------------------------------------------------------
dummy - dummy plugin for use in testing
ipmi - OpenIPMI based plugin
ipmidirect - IPMI plugin that talks to device driver directly
snmp_bc - IBM Blade Center plugin (uses snmp)
watchdog - Linux watchdog device interface
sysfs - Linux sysfs plugin (LM sensors and I2C devices exported in 
        sysfs requires kernel 2.6 or >= 2.5.72)
