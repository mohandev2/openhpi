This is an implementation of the Service Availability Forum's 
Hardware Platform Interface B.01.01 specification.

The following components are supported:
* OpenHPI base library
* OpenHPI utility library
* Dummy Plugin
* SNMP BladeCenter/RSA Plugin
* IPMI Plugin
* HPI Clients

The following components are beta:
* IMPI Direct Plugin

Feedback, as always, is welcome and encouraged.

---------------------------------------------------------
PREREQUISITES
---------------------------------------------------------
The following software is required to build openhpi

autoconf >= 2.57
automake >= 1.5
gcc      >= 3.2.0
uuid.h      (may be found in e2fsprogs-devel or uuid-dev)
GLIB-2.0	

The follow libraries are needed to build certain plugins

ipmi plugin
  OpenIPMI >= 0.26 (http://openipmi.sf.net)  suggest tip of CVS.

sysfs plugin
  libsysfs = 0.3

snmp_bc plugin
  net-snmp >= 5.07

snmp_client plugin
  net-snmp >= 5.07

---------------------------------------------------------
BUILD / INSTALLATION
---------------------------------------------------------

FOR RELEASED TARBALLS

Use standard UNIX mechanisms:
./configure && make && make install

Note: by default all plugins that *can* be built, will be built, all
other plugins will be silently disabled.

If you wish to disable a plugin, any flags you pass to configure
will be passed to the configure program.

i.e. ./configure --disable-dummy will disable the dummy plugin

then make (or make rpm)
and then (as root or with proper system install permissions)
	make install (or install from the rpm).

It will install the openhpi library, enabled plug-ins and sample 
applications that uses the library and plug-ins.

NOTE: the configuration file is only installed by the RPM installation.
	If you run "make install" manually, you will need to:
		cp examples/openhpi.conf.example /etc/openhpi/openhpi.conf
	and modify it for your needs.

FOR CVS EXTRACTS

First time to extract the code:
run ./bootstrap *first*

This will generate all files needed to compile.

You can then use the instructions provided for RELEASED TARBALLS

---------------------------------------------------------
CLEANUP
---------------------------------------------------------
To remove the temporary build files, type:

make clean

If you are a maintainer, and need to remove all autogenerated files, type:

make clean
make maintainer-clean


---------------------------------------------------------
Active Plug-ins
---------------------------------------------------------
dummy - dummy plugin for use in testing
ipmi - OpenIPMI based plugin
ipmidirect - IPMI plugin that talks to device driver directly
snmp_bc - IBM BladeCenter/RSA plugin (uses snmp)
watchdog - Linux watchdog device interface
sysfs - Linux sysfs plugin (LM sensors and I2C devices exported in 
        sysfs requires kernel 2.6 or >= 2.5.72)
