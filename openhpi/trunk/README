This is an implementation of the Service Availability Forum's 
Hardware Platform Interface specification.
The header file was obtained from www.saforum.org/specification/download.

---------------------------------------------------------
PREREQUISITES
---------------------------------------------------------
The following software is required to build openhpi

autoconf >= 2.50
automake >= 1.5
uuid.h      (may be found in e2fsprogs-devel or uuid-dev)
OpenIPMI >= 0.26 (http://openipmi.sf.net)
GLIB-1.2	(note we may be switching to 2.0 in the next release)

---------------------------------------------------------
BUILD / INSTALLATION
---------------------------------------------------------
First time to extract the code:
run ./BigBuild

This will generate all files needed to compile.

Note: by default all plugins that can be built, will be built.

If you wish to disable a plugin, any flags you pass to BigBuild 
will be passed to the configure program.

i.e. ./BigBuild --disable-dummy will disable the dummy plugin

then make (or make rpm)
and then (as root or with proper system install permissions)
	make install (or install from the rpm).

It will generate the openhpi library and sample applications
that uses the library.

---------------------------------------------------------
CLEANUP
---------------------------------------------------------
To remove the temporary build files, type:

make clean

If you are a maintainer, and need to remove all autogenerated files, type:

make clean
make maintainer-clean
