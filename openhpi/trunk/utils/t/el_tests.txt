The possitive tests:
   - Create a new EL via oh_el_create (001)
      - examine EL struct
   - Create a new EL, add 1 entry (002)
      - examine total number of entries in struct. Should be 1.
      - Compare entry in EL with entry used for adding to EL.
   - Create a new EL, add 5 entries (003)
      - examine total number of entries in struct. Should be 5.
      - Compare entries in EL with entries used for adding to EL.
   - Create a new EL, add 5 entries. Save EL to file (004)
      - Restore saved EL to another new EL struct.
      - Compare number of entries between the two logs.
   - Create a new EL, add 10 entries. Save EL to file (005)
      - Restore saved EL to another new EL struct.
      - Compare entries between the two logs.
   - Create a new EL, add 5 entries. Save EL to file (006)
      - Restore saved EL to another new EL struct.
      - Add 5 entries to first and second EL.
      - Check number of entries (Should be 10)
      - Compare entries with original ones.
   - Create a new El with a modified timestamp offset (007)
      - add 1 new entry, examine timestamp.
   - Create a new EL, add 5 entries. Clear the EL (008)
      - Examine EL to make sure that there are no entries.
