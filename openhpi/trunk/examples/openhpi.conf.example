#File foramt is easy

###First section, declare plugin to use:
#example:

#plugin	plugin-name

#plugin	libdummy

#Depends on openipmi to be installed on this system:
plugin libipmi

#Depends on net-snmp being installed on the system:
#plugin libsnmp_bc


###Second section is a handler (instance) declaration with arguments understood by plugin
#Strings are enclosed by "", numbers are not.

#handler	libdummy {
#        entity_root = "{SYSTEM_CHASSIS,0}"
#        name = "test"
#	addr =	0
#}

# Dummy allows you open second virtual by addr 1
#handler	libdummy {
#	addr =	1
#}

#section for ipmi plugin using SMI -- local interface

handler libipmi	{
	name = "smi"
	addr = 0
}

#Section for ipmi plugin based on OpenIPMI:

#handler libipmi {
#	name = "lan"
#	addr = "x.x.x.x" 	#ipaddress
#	port = 999
#	auth_type = "straight"
#	auth_level= "user"
#	username = "joe"
#	password = "blow"
#}

#Section for snmp_bc plugin:
#The root entry can be omitted in 'entity_root',
#but not the chassis entry.
#handler libsnmp_bc {
#        host = "bc.ibm.com"
#        community = "community"
#        entity_root = "{SYSTEM_CHASSIS,0}"
#}
