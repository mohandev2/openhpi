#File format is outlined here and examples are given

###First section, declare global parameters
#example:
#global {
#        OPENHPI_LOG_SEV = "MAJOR"
#}
#Parameters in the global stanza will be converted to
#environment variables.
#Here you can set which events will be logged in the domain
#system event log based on severity: CRITICAL, MAJOR, MINOR,
#INFORMATIONAL,OK, and DEBUG.

###Second section, declare plugin to use:
#example:

#plugin	plugin-name

plugin	libdummy

#Depends on openipmi to be installed on this system:
#plugin libipmi

#Depends on net-snmp being installed on the system:
#plugin libsnmp_bc

#Depends openhpi being configured 
#"configure --enable-dummy=static":
#plugin dummy

#plugin libipmidirect

##**WARNING** System administrators have to make sure that entity paths are

###Third section is a handler (instance) declaration with arguments understood by plugin
#Strings are enclosed by "", numbers are not.
