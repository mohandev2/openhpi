========================================================================
This package provides windows version of
- Base HPI library (libopenhpi.dll)
- OpenHPI utils library (libopenhpiutils.dll)
- OpenHPI marshal library (libopenhpimarshal.dll)
- OpenHPI transport library (libopenhpitransport.dll)
- OpenHPI clients:
-- hpialarms.exe
-- hpidomain.exe
-- hpiel.exe
-- hpievents.exe
-- hpifan.exe
-- hpigensimdata.exe
-- hpiinv.exe
-- hpionIBMblade.exe
-- hpipower.exe
-- hpireset.exe
-- hpisensor.exe
-- hpisettime.exe
-- hpithres.exe
-- hpitop.exe
-- hpitree.exe
-- hpiwdt.exe
-- hpixml.exe
-- ohdomainlist.exe
-- ohhandler.exe
-- ohparam.exe
- OpenHPI daemon as a console Windows application (openhpid.exe)
-- Slave plug-in (libslave.dll)

The package also provides necessary glib2 libraries:
- libglib-2.0-0.dll
- libgthread-2.0-0.dll
- libgmodule-2.0-0.dll

NB: glib2 libraries were obtained in binary form from 
http://www.gtk.org/download-windows.html and were included 
without any change.
NB: glib2 is distributed under LGPL2 license.

The package can include additional auxiliary libraries.

========================================================================
Dependencies:

The only dependence (save for mingw compiler) is glib2.
Windows version can be obtained at http://www.gtk.org/download-windows.html

========================================================================
Current windows build system supports only mingw compiler.
http://www.mingw.org/
However the built libraries can be use as ordinary windows DLL
in projects with any compiler.

========================================================================
Build instructions:

- Get mingw (cross or native).
- Get archive with glib2 for windows and unpack it somewhere.
- Enter OpenHPI source tree root directory.
- Modify Makefile.mingw32.def:
-- ARCH in order to point architecture for produced binaries
-- TOOLCHAIN_PATH in order that CC, CXX and AS point to correct files.
-- GLIB_DIR: in order that GLIB_INCLUDES and GLIB_LIBS
   point to valid directories with glib headers and libraries.
- Run "make -f Makefile.mingw32".
- Run "make -f Makefile.mingw32 out".
- The openhpi-${VERSION}-win32-${ARCH} sub-directory will contain all produced stuff.
- Optional step - strip produced exe and dll files.

========================================================================
Client Usage instructions:

There are two ways:

Way 1) prepare openhpiclient.conf and set env. var. OPENHPICLIENT_CONF
to its path

Way 2) set env. var. OPENHPI_DAEMON_HOST to OpenHPI daemon address.

========================================================================
Library Usage instructions:

Header file SaHpi.h contains declarations on provided HPI functions.
Header file oHpi.h contains declarations on provided OpenHPI extension functions.
The functions are in libopenhpi.dll.

Define "SAHPI_API" macro as "__declspec(dllimport)".

For mingw compiler it can be just linked.

For MSVC:
- There is def file libopenhpi.def
- With lib tool you can create import library
- Command example "lib /machine:i386 /def:libopenhpi.def"
- Point produced import library in Project settings

For application running and distribution::
- copy necessary libraries to your application dir.

And see Client Usage instructions about configuring OpenHPI daemon address
to connect.

========================================================================
Library Known Issues:

===================================================
Seems mingw has its own copy of environment variables.
So the code:

    _putenv("OPENHPI_DAEMON_HOST=...");
    rv = saHpiSessionOpen(...)

does not work in MSVC as expected.
But setting any variable before running executable works!

===================================================
Seems client applications do not close sockets.
The sockets remain in TIME_WAIT state.
It can exhaust system resources.

========================================================================
Daemon Usage instructions:

Only Slave plug-in is now ported under Windows.

- prepare openhpi.conf
- openhpid.exe -n -v -c "path to openhpi.conf"

As an optional step you can do 
- set OPENHPI_UID_MAP="path to uid map file"
before running openhpid.exe.
The uid map file will be used for persistent
resource id <-> entity path mapping.

NB: -v is optional flag for verbose messages.
