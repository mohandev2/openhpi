This directory contains the openhpi daemon and client library.

connection.c        - socket handling
marshal.c           - general mashaling code
marshal_hpi.c       - marshaling of HPI functions
marshal_hpi_types.c - mashaling of HPI types and structures
openhpiclient.c     - open HPI client code
openhpiclient.conf  - sample configuration for the client library
openhpid.cpp        - the daemon
simple_config.c     - general config file reading code

To run type:
openhpid -d 7
This enables debug messages of the daemon.

To use the daemon link you HPI application with -lopenhpiclient
not -lopenhpi. To run hpitest with the daemon/client library just
change hpitest/v1/1.0/LDFLAGS. One of the event tests will hang.
Be aware, hpitest will run in unexpected high speed.
