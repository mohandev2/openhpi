/*
 * Common OpenHPI implementation specific definitions 
 * --------------------------------------------------
 *
 * plugin - software component contained in a shared library that exports
 *          a function named 'get_interface'.  Loading a plugin entails 
 *          performing a dlopen on the library, finding 'get_interface' with
 *          dl_sym, and calling 'get_interface' to get an interface pointer
 *          (referred to as the 'abi'.)
 *
 * abi - pointer to a structure of type oh_abi_XX where XX represents a
 *       version of the structure.  This structure is a bundle of function
 *       pointers that represents the interface between a given plug-in
 *       instance (known as a handler), and the OpenHPI infrastructure.
 *
 * handler - an instance of a plugin represented by a structure of type
 *           oh_handler which contains an abi and a pointer to an instance 
 *           specific data structure that is private to the plug-in.
 */

/*
 * How plugins are instantiated
 * ----------------------------
 *
 * When an HPI application initializes OpenHPI by calling saHpiInitialize(),
 * the OpenHPI infrastructure will seek out all configured plug-ins
 * (see oh_config.h for details on how a plug-in is configured), and:
 * 1. load the plug-in into memory 
 * 2. extract an abi from the plug-in
 * 3. create a new oh_plugin containing the name of the plugin and
 *    the abi extracted from the plugin
 * 4. add the oh_plugin to the global list of plugins
 *
 * The first time the HPI application creates a new session by calling 
 * saHpiSessionOpen(), the OpenHPI infrastructure will once again examine
 * the implementation configuration and create new plug-in instances
 * (i.e. a handler) as the configuration dictates.  
 * 
 * Each handler configuration item will specify:
 * 1. name of plugin in question
 * 2. additional arguments understood by the plug-in
 *
 * Each new handler is created by:
 * 1. finding the oh_plugin containing the same plugin name as the 
 *    configuration item
 * 2. using the abi found in the oh_plugin to call abi->open(), passing
 *    the additional plug-in specific arguments to the open function.  
 *    The open call will return a void* pointer (known as hnd) that is 
 *    required to be passed back to the plug-in for all further abi 
 *    function calls.
 * 3. creating a new oh_handler that contains a pointer to the associated
 *    abi, and the hnd returned by the open function.
 */

/*
 * How plugins can have multiple instances open at the same time
 * -------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * The key to a plugin being able to support multiple instances
 * is in the 'void *hnd' passed to all abi functions (except open().)
 * The intent is that hnd is used as a private pointer to an instance specific
 * data structure.
 *
 * For example, if a plug-in were created to allow an HPI implementation
 * running a remote server to inter-operate with the local OpenHPI
 * implementation, then the plug-in could be written such that:
 * 1. the plugin defines a new structure containing an event queue and tcp
 *    socket to the remote machine
 * 2. the plugin requires that handler configuration entries for this
 *    plugin to contain the IP address of the remote machine to connect
 * 3. when open() is called, the plugin 
 *    - opens a socket to the new machine
 *    - allocates a new event queue
 *    - allocates a new instance structure
 *    - stores the event queue and socket in the instance structure
 *    - returns a pointer to the structure as 'hnd'.
 * 4. as other abi functions are called, the 'hnd' passed in with those
 *    functions is cast back to a pointer to the instance data, and then
 *    communicates over the socket in that structure to service the given 
 *    request.
