================================================================================
This directory contains baselib implementations for different programming
languages.
Current language set is:
- C#
- Java
- Python

================================================================================
NB: Those are baselib implementations.
    Those are not wrappers for libopenhpi.so/libopenhpi.dll.
    So you don't have to install OpenHPI C libraries and Glib to get them
    working.

================================================================================
Datatypes and API Representation:

SAF HPI is C based API so it has to be represented somehow to fit in another
programming language model. The main idea is to keep as much resemblance to
original SAF API as possible.
