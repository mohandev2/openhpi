This is an implementation of the Service Availability Forum's 
Hardware Platform Interface specification.
The header file was obtained from www.saforum.org/specification/download.

---------------------------------------------------------
PREREQUISITES
---------------------------------------------------------
The following software is required to build openhpi

autoconf >= 2.50
automake >= 1.5
uuid.h      (may be found in e2fsprogs-devel or uuid-dev)
OpenIPMI >= 0.26 (http://openipmi.sf.net)
GLIB-1.2	(note we may be switching to 2.0 in the next release)

---------------------------------------------------------
BUILD / INSTALLATION
---------------------------------------------------------
First time to extract the code:
run ./BigBuild

This will generate all files needed to compile.

Note: by default, only the dummy plugin is enabled.

If you want to enable the IPMI plugin, do either:
Edit the BigBuid script and in the 
	./configure line add
	./configure --enable-ipmi
of after running the BigBuild script, run:
	./configure--enable-ipmi

then make (or make rpm)
and then (as root or with proper system install permissions)
	make install (or install from the rpm).

It will generate the openhpi library and a sample application 
that uses the library.

---------------------------------------------------------
CLEANUP
---------------------------------------------------------
To remove the temporary build files, type:

make clean

If you are a maintainer, and need to remove all autogenerated files, type:

make clean
make maintainer-clean
