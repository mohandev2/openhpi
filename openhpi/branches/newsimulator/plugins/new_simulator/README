@mainpage New Simulator plugin

@section intro Introduction
With the simulation plugins it is possible to run the openhpi daemon
locally without having hardware for it in the background.\n
Since the new simulation plugin gets its simulation data from a file instead
of having it inside the code, the data can be changed without compiling the 
plugin afterwards.\n
In combination with the \c hpigensimdata client you can generate your own
simulation data based on a running system e.g. for demonstration purposes 
\- see also @ref data.\n
The plugin is written in C++ and adapts the ipmidirect plugin for simulation 
purposes. Therefore you will find many conformities between both plugins.\n
Since it was tried not to introduce new libraries, the gnu lexical scanner was
used for parsing the simulation data as it is used for the \e openhpid.conf 
file. A documentation of this scanner can be found at:
http://library.gnome.org/devel/glib/stable/glib-Lexical-Scanner.html\n
Don't hit me, but the documention was not done by the \c openhpi recommended
tool. Instead of this \c doxygen is used for this purpose. The doxygen
configuration file \c Doxyfile can be found in the main directory of the 
plugin. The documentation itself is in the file \c doc.html.tgz. A good 
description of this tool can be found at:
http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/index.html\n

@section architecture Plugin architecture
As already mentioned the new simulator plugin is adapted from the ipmidirect
plugin. Therefore many conformities can be found. For example the usage of
two C definitions blocks in \c new_sim.cpp and \c ipmi.cpp wasn't changed. 
(Maybe I will change it in near future due to documentation purpose.).\n


@section data Simulation data
The NewSimulator plugin reads at start a simulation file which includes the 
data to be simulated. The filename can be defined inside the plugin section 
of \e openhpid.conf. The default filename is \e simulation.data. The file can be
found in the directory of the \e openhpid.conf file.\n 
The file itself is read only one time during the discovery phase. This means that
the daemon has to be restarted if changes were made and should take effect.\n
Small changes can be done easily in the file but if a whole system hardware
should be simulated it is recommended to use the \c hpigensimdata client which
is described in @ref datagen.

@subsection datagen Generating own simulation data
To generate a simulation file including the data of an own system, it is 
recommended to use the client \c hpigensimdata \c -f \c \<filename\>.\n
The content of \c \<filename\> is in ascii and can be modified using a text
editor of chose. But at changing the file you should be aware to set the 
parenthesis correctly and take the correct names of variables.\n
With the exception of config section and the token marks, all variable
names are equivalent to the variables defined inside \c SafHpi.h. The 
values of the unions and defines are put as integer or hex values inside the 
file to spare the decoding at startup of the daemon (and development efforts 
;-)).\n 
You can use this client also for dump a running system. But keep in mind that 
for reading e.g. the capability fields it is much easier to transfers also
the values properly to text, which is not done by this client.\n
