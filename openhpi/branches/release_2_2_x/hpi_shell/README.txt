		hpi_cmd

	Command interface to an Openhpi system.

Synopsis:

	hpi_cmd [-c <cfgfile>] [-e] [-f <file name>]

Description:

	The hpi_cmd allows show and control Openhpi resources. It runs in two modes:
		- packet;
		- dialog;
	Before executing commands hpi_cmd opens HPI session for a default domain and
	runs discovery in it. In the packet mode commands are read from the input file
	passed with -f option or as a parameter for the run command. In the dialog
	mode commands are read from the standard input (stdin).
	Lines beginning with a # are comments. Symbol ; is a delimiter in a command
	sequance.

Options:

	-c <cfgfile>
		<cfgfile> is used as a Openhpi configuration file.

	-e
		Event is enable and show events in the short format, subscribe for
		events, before discovery call.

	-f <file name>
		Execute a command file <file name>.

Redirection output.

	Output of the command can be redirect to the local file:
		command > file		- redirect standard output to the passed file.
		command >> file		- add standard output to the passed file.

Packet mode.

	In this mode commands are read from the command file. All commands described
	before are available in the packet mode. If the executed command is fail the
	packet mode is canceled and switches to the dialog mode.


Hpi_cmd is a client of the Openhpi daemon.

	Hpi_cmd can run as a client of the Openhpi daemon. For this purpose you must
	configure Openhpi with flag --enable-shell_client :

		./configure --enable-shell_client

	In this case openhpid and hpi_cmp are built.
