New OpenHPI Daemon Model:
======================
The Default build and installation configuration for OpenHPI has been 
move to the Daemon model.  This results in several operational and 
usage changes.

Three Methods for using the Daemon:
==========================
There are three methods for starting the daemon at this point; manually 
calling the installed 'init script',  manually starting the daemon in 
the foreground,  or installing the 'init script' in one of the system 
run levels and letting the system manage the daemon's execution.  

Manually Calling Init Script:
-----------------------------------
You can START and STOP the Daemon with the 'openhpid' init script.  This 
scriptstarts the daemon.  An HPI consumer application is now ready to  link 
to 'libopenhpi' and begin interacting with the daemon.  

This script can be found in '/usr/local/etc/init.d/openhpid' or 
alternately if installed in one of the system run levels in 
'/etc/init.d/openhpid'. 

Example To Start:
$sudo /usr/local/etc/init.d/openhpid start
Starting openhpid:			[  OK  ]
$

Example To Stop:
$sudo /usr/local/etc/init.d/openhpid stop
Stopping openhpid:			[  OK  ]
$

Installing Daemon into a Run Level:
--------------------------------------------
By using the installation script 'install_initd' the run script 'openhpid' 
can be installed in one the system run levels.  This configuration most 
closely matches a production machine.

Manually Starting Daemon (Running Daemon in Sandbox):
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
After performing 'make install' the 'openhpid' init script will reside 
in '<DESTDIR>/etc/init.d/openhpid' and the binary daemon 'openhpid' 
will reside in '<DESTDIR>/sbin/openhpid'. 

If the 'openhpid' init scritp is not used it will be necessary to manually 

1 .  start daemon 'openhpid [options] [-c <path to openhpi.conf>]'  

To start the daemon in the forground use the '-n' option.  For more info 
'openhpid -h'.

Example: '>openhpid -n -c/etc/openhpi/openhpi.conf'

This method will allow you to run the daemon in the foreground.  See 
'http://wiki.openhpi.org/OpenHPI/Manual/OpenHPIDaemon'.

Example:
From Daemon Shell
>sudo  openhpid -n -c/etc/openhpi/openhpi.conf
openhpid started.
OPENHPI_CONF = /etc/openhpi/openhpi.conf
OPENHPI_DAEMON_PORT = 4743

Note: if you desire debugging info 
>export OPENHPI_DEBUG=YES
>export OPENHPI_DEBUG_TRACE=YES
warning: All debug data will be sent to '/var/log/messages' as well.  Depending on volume 
you storage may become completely consumed.
